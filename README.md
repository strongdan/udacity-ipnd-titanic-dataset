<h2>Project Specification: Investigate a Dataset</h2>

<b>Code Functionality</b>
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Criteria</th>
    <th>Meets Specifications</th> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Does the code work?</td>
    <td>All code is functional and produces no errors when run. The code given is sufficient to reproduce the results described.</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Does the project use NumPy and Pandas appropriately?</td>
    <td>The project uses NumPy arrays and Pandas Series and DataFrames where appropriate rather than Python lists and dictionaries. Where possible, vectorized operations and built-in functions are used instead of loops.</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Does the project use good coding practices?</td>
    <td>The code makes use of functions to avoid repetitive code. The code contains good comments and variable names, making it easy to read.</td>

<b>Quality of Analysis</b>

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Criteria</th>
    <th>Meets Specifications</th> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Is a question clearly posed?</td>
    <td>The project clearly states one or more questions, then addresses those questions in the rest of the analysis.</td> 
  </tr>

<b>Data Wrangling Phase</b>

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Criteria</th>
    <th>Meets Specifications</th> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Is the data cleaning well documented?</td>
    <td>The project documents any changes that were made to clean the data, such as merging multiple files, handling missing values, etc.</td> 
  </tr>

<b>Exploration Phase</b>

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Criteria</th>
    <th>Meets Specifications</th> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Is the data explored in many ways?</td>
    <td>The project investigates the stated question(s) from multiple angles. At least three variables are investigated using both single-variable (1d) and multiple-variable (2d) explorations.</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Are there a variety of relevant visualizations and statistical summaries?</td>
    <td><p>The project's visualizations are varied and show multiple comparisons and trends. Relevant statistics are computed throughout the analysis when an inference is made about the data.</p><p>At least two kinds of plots should be created as part of the explorations.</p></td> 
  </tr>

<b>Conclusions Phase</b>

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Criteria</th>
    <th>Meets Specifications</th> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Has the student correctly communicated tentativeness of findings?</td>
    <td>The results of the analysis are presented such that any limitations are clear. The analysis does not state or imply that one change causes another based solely on a correlation.</td>

<b>Communication</b>

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Criteria</th>
    <th>Meets Specifications</th>

  <tr>
    <td>Is the flow of the analysis easy to follow?</td>
    <td>Reasoning is provided for each analysis decision, plot, and statistical summary.</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Is the data visualized using appropriate plots and parameter choices?</td>
    <td>Visualizations made in the project depict the data in an appropriate manner that allows plots to be readily interpreted.</td>

<b>Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out!</b>
* Use Markdown cells to report your findings.
* Utilize NumPy or Pandas functionality that goes beyond what was covered in the course.
* Use statistical tests to draw rigorous conclusions where appropriate.
